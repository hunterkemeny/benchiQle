# benchiQle
(pronounced "ben-cha-cuhl")

Aspiring to be a comprehensive benchmarking tool for quantum compilers.

Currently runs the max_depth, speed, and memory footprint metrics on all benchmarks from QASMBench and from red-queen that do not have "gate" in their qasm file.

Simply run `./run.sh` from the command line. 

Stay tuned for more benchmarks, more metrics, more compiler options to be run from the command line or jupyter notebooks.
